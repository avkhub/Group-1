PersonalViz:Images

To visualize your system behaviour with respect to top-applications/frequency/task-category or just know what you did and when!
PersonalViz is a visualization system that gives the user a sense of his/her behavior. This personal viz is for all users that use a computing device for their day to day activities. To help the users analyze what tasks and activities they perform during the day/s and for how long.To deduce their work patterns, compare their activities across days/hours.
To allow the user to get an overview of how did they spend a span of time and determine the activities they performed in a selected time interval.
Dealing with Real-time data provided by Professor and the project members, the PersonalViz provides usage patterns concluding the user’s day to day schedule , their likes/dislikes , method of working on things simultaneously or few at a time and so on.

## Description

  To build a visualization system that gives the user a sense of his/her behavior. 
This personal viz is for all users that use a computing device for their day to day activities. To help the users analyze what tasks and activities they perform during the day/s and for how long.To deduce their work patterns, compare their activities across days/hours.

   Personal Viz uses the data that will consist of activities that a user will carry out on his/her computing device throughout the day. The data is collected from the InputLog (desktop application) and RescueTime(API) from all the project Team members and Professor.

### Limitations and Future Works:

Limited Data (few months) and hence couldn’t visualize trends for all months.   
Future work  - feeding (collect data) in more data into application.  
Future work - adding a new feature in the application - for the user should be able to feed his data into application through user interface.  
Future work - make use if more metrics like “keyboard strokes” , “mouse focus” from different data collecting applications.
