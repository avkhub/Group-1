## Description
**Visualize your system behaviour with respect to top-applications/frequency/task-category or just know what you did and when!**    
  
  
   The goal of the project is to build a visualization system that gives the user a sense of his/her behavior. This personal viz is for all users that use a computing device for their day to day activities. To help the users analyze what tasks and activities they perform during the days and for how long and also to deduce their work patterns or compare their activities across days/hours.

   Personal Viz uses the data that will consist of activities that a user will carry out on his/her computing device throughout the day. The data is collected from the InputLog (desktop application) and RescueTime(API) from all the project Team members and Professor. The data produced the the RescueTime application will be in a form of CSV and contains the date, TimeSpent, Activity and category.
   The RescueTime data which is downloaded through API is now processed by the python scripts to produce more limited information for displaying a particular visualization.  

  This visualization can answer some of important questions like the following:  
 
  What is the user’s time spent behavior over a span of time?  
  What activities are performed in a given timespan/day?  
  What is the amount of time spent on an activity and also frequency of an activity?  
  Can the usage of multiple activities be compared to gain useful insights?

### Limitations and Future Works:

1. Limited Data (few months) and hence couldn’t visualize trends for all months.   
2. Future work  - feeding (collect data) in more data into application.  
3. Future work - adding a new feature in the application - for the user should be able to feed his data into application through user interface.  
4. Future work - make use if more metrics like “keyboard strokes” , “mouse focus” from different data collecting applications.
